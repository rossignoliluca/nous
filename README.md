# How to Read Cycle Reports

Cycle reports are generated by NOUS to provide insights into its operational cycles. These reports are stored in JSON format and can be found in the `data/cycles/` directory.

### JSON Structure
- **timestamp**: The time when the cycle was completed.
- **observations**: Key observations made during the cycle.
- **actions**: Actions taken by NOUS in response to observations.
- **insights**: Insights extracted from the cycle for future reference.
- **self_modifications**: Any changes NOUS made to its own configuration.

Understanding these fields will help you interpret the cycle reports and gain insights into NOUS's decision-making processes.
